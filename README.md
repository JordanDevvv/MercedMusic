# MercedMusic
A spotify music application for UC Merced Students allows for students to see what other students are listening too once logged in
I collaborated on this Merced music web application with two other students, I was focused on backend development. If your noticing a lack of commits over time its because my previous github account had been hacked, but the backend it mostly developed by me. This project was saved on my hardrive. 



# MercedMusic

## Project Overview
MercedMusic is a Spotify-integrated web application designed for UC Merced students to discover what other students are currently listening to. After logging in, users can view shared listening activity across the campus, fostering a sense of community through music.

## Application Architecture
MercedMusic was developed collaboratively by a team of three students. Development responsibilities were divided between frontend and backend components, allowing parallel development and efficient collaboration.

## Backend Development
The backend of MercedMusic was built using Python and the Flask framework. It serves as the core API layer of the application and is responsible for:

- Handling user authentication and session management  
- Integrating with the Spotify Web API to retrieve listening data  
- Managing RESTful API routes for user and music data  
- Processing and returning data to the frontend in JSON format  

Flask was chosen for its lightweight design and ease of integration with external APIs.

## Frontend Integration
The frontend communicates with the Flask backend to display real-time music data. Once authenticated, users are able to:

- View what other UC Merced students are listening to  
- Interact with a dynamic interface driven by backend responses  

## Collaboration & Workflow
This project was developed using Git and GitHub for version control. Backend and frontend components were developed in parallel, enabling smooth collaboration and code integration among team members.

## Technologies Used
- Flask (Python)
- Spotify Web API
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
